> *eorgeK:* Issue 39: Retailers gard against fraudlent versions. forward. of their titles being sold through other sites..

**Naiomi:** This is with big retailers, like Amazon..  

> *Zakim sees Naomi  on the speaker queue:* Zakim sees Naomi_ on the speaker queue.

**Naomi Kennedy:** I am a developer andhaving a security key will not work. We have to be able to idenify duplicate content..  

> *eorgeK:* A legitimate is submitted, then another title is submitted with a minor change in the title, and it is not flagged as the identical title..

> *eorgeK:* I do not have a solution. Amazon cannot identify the fradualent title..

> *Zakim sees Naomi , Bill Kasdorf  on the speaker queue:* Zakim sees Naomi_, Bill_Kasdorf_ on the speaker queue.

> *eorgeK:* Block chain was suggested, but that failed. It is less about a DRM total prevention and more about helping retailers to identify fraud..

> *eorgeK:* We have to help retailers manage the self publishing environment. I am speaking for myself, not PRH..

> *eorgeK:* The fradulent title is sold at a dollar cheaper and that sales increases and it climbs above the the original title..

**Bill:** This gets misnamed as piracy, but counterfitting is a better word..  

**Naomi Kennedy:** Bootleged version is another term..  

**Bill:** Does it make sence for the CG to formally attack this issue?.  

> *Zakim sees Naomi , Bill Kasdorf , AvneeshSingh on the speaker queue:* Zakim sees Naomi_, Bill_Kasdorf_, AvneeshSingh on the speaker queue.

**Naomi Kennedy:** I cannot lead it, but can participate..  

**Bill:** We could recruit from outside the CG to chair this TF..  

**Naomi Kennedy:** We need retailer involvement..  

> *Zakim sees Naomi , Bill Kasdorf  on the speaker queue:* Zakim sees Naomi_, Bill_Kasdorf_ on the speaker queue.

> *Zakim sees Naomi , Bill Kasdorf  on the speaker queue:* Zakim sees Naomi_, Bill_Kasdorf_ on the speaker queue.

> *vneeshSingh:* +1 it is esentail to have retailers like Amazon in this task force.

> *eorgeK:* This is a test about splitting EPUBs..

> *eorgeK:* Are there any use cases?.

> *heng xu:* GeorgeK: During work on narration for text book I have encountered some book as large as a few GB and we had to split it to separate CDs.

> *Zakim sees Naomi , Bill Kasdorf  on the speaker queue:* Zakim sees Naomi_, Bill_Kasdorf_ on the speaker queue.

> *heng xu:* ... I believe some retailer has size limitation for distribution.

> *heng xu:* Naomi_: everything larger than 1GB will likely being kicked out from CMS.

**George Kerscher:** Large textbooks were very large and were split over several CDs..  

> *heng xu:* ... some unix platform can not accept maybe 2GB book.

> *heng xu:* ... and you can not really sell them. In reality anything larger than 750 MB will likely have issue.

> *heng xu:* charlesn: is there a general rule for epub file size?.

> *heng xu:* Naomi_: 750 MB is a practical size rather than spec.

**Naomi Kennedy:** Individual distribution is fine, but through retailers there are serious problems. 750mb seems to be a limit. Anything over that gets stuck in Amazon's ingestion system..  

> *eorgeK:* Anything over the 750 mb limit requires hand holding to go through their system..

> *Zakim sees Naomi , Bill Kasdorf , zheng xu on the speaker queue:* Zakim sees Naomi_, Bill_Kasdorf_, zheng_xu on the speaker queue.

> *Zakim sees Naomi , Bill Kasdorf , zheng xu, AvneeshSingh on the speaker queue:* Zakim sees Naomi_, Bill_Kasdorf_, zheng_xu, AvneeshSingh on the speaker queue.

> *tzviya tzviya joins:* tzviya tzviya joins.

**Jeff Jaffe:** Comics may have issues with limitations on size as well..  

> *Zakim sees Naomi , Bill Kasdorf , zheng xu, AvneeshSingh, GeorgeK on the speaker queue:* Zakim sees Naomi_, Bill_Kasdorf_, zheng_xu, AvneeshSingh, GeorgeK on the speaker queue.

> *heng xu:* GeorgeK: DAISY was able to accept huge epub file so it has to be converted.

**George Kerscher:** DAISY does have a title available that could be used for stress testing..  

> *Zakim sees Naomi , Bill Kasdorf , zheng xu, AvneeshSingh, GeorgeK on the speaker queue:* Zakim sees Naomi_, Bill_Kasdorf_, zheng_xu, AvneeshSingh, GeorgeK on the speaker queue.

**Avneesh Singh:** Technically, it can be done, but is the responsibility on the publisher? The retailer may not have rights to split a title..  

**Naomi Kennedy:** It is not about making three separate EPUBtitles, but how to split a title over three zip files. It needs to be seemless to the end user..  

**Jeff Jaffe:** zip does not recognize how three separate ziples relate to each other..  

> *vneeshSingh:* Thanks this makes it more clear..

> *Zakim sees Naomi , Bill Kasdorf , zheng xu, AvneeshSingh, GeorgeK, Michelle  on the speaker queue:* Zakim sees Naomi_, Bill_Kasdorf_, zheng_xu, AvneeshSingh, GeorgeK, Michelle_ on the speaker queue.

**Naomi Kennedy:** Not all ebooks are trade. When you get to the use case where people are creating separate EPUB that are related to each other..

**Naomi Kennedy:** As video gets more common and as images get larger, this problem will not go away.s.  

> *Zakim sees Naomi , Bill Kasdorf , zheng xu, GeorgeK, Michelle , tzviya on the speaker queue:* Zakim sees Naomi_, Bill_Kasdorf_, zheng_xu, GeorgeK, Michelle_, tzviya on the speaker queue.

**Michelle:** From the library perspective, books that have audio and text are a problem..  

> *eorgeK:* I am not talking about something like Libby, but academic collections that is ingested. We are not talking about the seemless experience from a public library, but the academic where the content is ingested in different places..

**Tzviya Siegman:** We are not talking about we are or not doing now, but we want to talk about what we want to do..  

> *eorgeK:* We need to open our minds and why we do not do this or that..

**Michelle:** The e Reader needs to be updated to support the content..  

> *Zakim sees Naomi , Bill Kasdorf , zheng xu, GeorgeK, Michelle , tzviya, paul belfanti  on the speaker queue:* Zakim sees Naomi_, Bill_Kasdorf_, zheng_xu, GeorgeK, Michelle_, tzviya, paul_belfanti_ on the speaker queue.

**Paul:** Education TF update.  

> *eorgeK:* As mentioned, we have set up a Doodle pole and scroll to September to fill out your availability..

> *eorgeK:* We are making a recommendation the EPUB WG that the Accessibility Summary would be a recommendation (should) and not a requirement (must)..
